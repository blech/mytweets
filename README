This is a fork of simonw's original mytweets script: 
http://github.com/simonw/mytweets/tree/master
via

mytweets is a script to back up all your tweets to a local file.
It can save them in JSON or Python's pickle format.

Directions:
1) Put fetch.py in any directory
2) Run 'chmod +x fetch.py'

Notes:
1) mytweets requires simplejson (unless Python 2.6) from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

Usage
1) To specify your username and passowrd, you can either
   create a file called config.py in the same directory as the script:

    USERNAME = 'your-twitter-username'
    PASSWORD = 'your-twitter-password'
    FILE_PATH = '/path/to/the/file/we/will/create/'

   or use the -u, -p and -f options on the command line.

2) Run the command like so:

   ./fetch.py [-u your-twitter-username -p your-twitter-password -f /path/to/the/file/we/will/create/] [-t]

3) The -t option will save your tweets to my_tweets.txt (pickle format).
   Otherwise your tweets will be saved to my_tweets.json.
   
4) Run the command again at any time to save any tweets created since
   you last ran the script.
